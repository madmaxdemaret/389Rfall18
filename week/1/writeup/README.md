### Part 2 (75 pts)

(The prompt is unclear whether this firmware is already out or is about ready to be released. As such, I went with about ready to be released because it made the ethics harder)

First you should tell your boss about the security issues. As the person responsible for auditing the security, you have both an ethical obligation and (probably) a legal obligation to report these issues to the person that has the best chance of fixing them.

The ethical dilemmas come depending on your boss's reaction to your report. Hopefully, they delay the release of the new firmware until fixes are made, in which case your ethical obligation is fulfilled.

In the case they release the flawed firmware but immediately start working on patching the flaws, then you should also not release anything. Notification about these flaws would mean hackers would start looking for them, and likely find them in the six months it would take to patch the flaws. In this case, you would be indirectly helping people cause harm.

In the case that the company either refuses to fix the exploits you found or they just assign a token team to work on the fixes, then you should take your findings to a consumer watchdog. Because your company is not going to fix the bugs, they become the group that most likely insures the bugs will be fixed.

I would not go to the public with the information because they will likely overreact to the problem which will hurt your company and coworkers.

Even if you do nothing, you are not ethically responsible for any harm that results in hackers exploiting the vulnerabilities you found. All the harm that they cause is solely their fault, and thus, their responsibility, not yours.
